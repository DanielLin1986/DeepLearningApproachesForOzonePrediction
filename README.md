# Predicting Ground-level Ozone Concentrations Using Deep Learning Networks  
This repository contains Python code designed to evaluate six prominent deep learning (DL) architectures for predicting ground-level ozone concentrations. The architectures under examination include the Fully Connected Network (FCN), commonly referred to as the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and several variants Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) models. Additionally, the repository features a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Transformer-based network, both of which are well-regarded for their performance in sequence modeling and attention mechanisms. Moreover, to provide a comprehensive comparison, the repository includes a model based on conventional Machine Learning (ML) techniquesâ€”LightGBM. This allows for an evaluation of how DL approaches stack up against established ML methods, offering a robust framework for assessing the effectiveness of various architectures in predicting ozone concentrations.
The implementation of DL models is based on Keras (version 2.6.0) with Tensorflow backend (version 2.6.0).
