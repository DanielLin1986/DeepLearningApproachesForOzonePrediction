# Predicting Ground-level Ozone Concentrations Using Deep Learning Networks  
This repository contains Python code designed to evaluate six prominent deep learning (DL) architectures for predicting ground-level ozone concentrations. The architectures under examination include the Fully Connected Network (FCN), commonly referred to as the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and several variants Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) models. Additionally, the  Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Transformer-based network are also involved. Moreover, to provide a comprehensive comparison, a conventional Machine Learning (ML) modelâ€”LightGBM is included. This allows for an evaluation of how DL approaches stack up against established ML methods, offering a robust framework for assessing the effectiveness of various architectures in predicting ozone concentrations. The implementation of DL models is based on Keras (version 2.6.0) with Tensorflow backend (version 2.6.0).
